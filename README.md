# 01_strings

Work on a clone of this repo and check into that as often as you can.
Ask Daryn on Slack if you are unsure on how to do this. 


Tasks:
* cd into the tests folder
* run the tests
  * ruby string_tests.rb
* Go through the tests, remove the skip line and make the tests pass

* Use what you learned in main.rb to write a small program
  * use: puts to display information to the console
  * use: gets to read input

E.g.

```ruby
puts "What is your name:"
name = gets
puts "Your name is #{name}"
```
